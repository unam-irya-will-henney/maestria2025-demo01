# Programación 2025 Demo

This is a demonstration repository for using github and integrating with vscode.  This text is written using the online editor github.dev. From the GitHub page of the repository, I opened github.dev by typing `.` (dot). This is a lightweight version of [GitHub Codespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Codespaces), which is a more full-featured online IDE.
